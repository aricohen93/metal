In this notebook, we'll investigate a single-task problem with synthetic data, with an emphasis on the basic design concepts of MeTaL. Check out the `tutorials/` directory to see how this basic pipeline extends to the full _multi-task_ setting, and other topics.\n",

    "This tutorial consists of four steps, following the basic [data programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723) pipeline as in [Snorkel](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/):\n",
    "1. **Load Data:** In the _weakly supervised_ setting, we only have access to unlabeled data points `X`, matrix of noisy labels `L`, and dev/test labels `Y`*\n",
    "2. **Train Label Model:** The purpose of the `LabelModel` is to estimate the unknown accuracies of the labeling functions, _without access to `Y`_, and then use this to denoise and combine them into a set of _probabilistic training labels_.\n",
    "3. **Train End Model:** We can then use these training labels to supervise a discriminative classifier!\n",
